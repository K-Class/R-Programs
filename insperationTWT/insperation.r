#Example: if the text file contained the following sentences in this order and the current week of the year was week 2, then the 
#program will post "have a good day!" to twitter:

#Psuedo List:
#"Be the best you can be !" - quote1
#"have a good day!" - quote2
#"You miss all the shots you never take" - quote3

#Install the appropriate packages
#install.packages("twitteR")
library("twitteR")
library("ISOweek")
